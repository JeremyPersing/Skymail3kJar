# Skymail3kJar
This is the jar file to a game that I made in my Object Oriented Programming class. 
The game is called Sky Mail 3000 and the main objective of the game is to make it from the first 
helipad to the last helipad without taking 100% damage. There are 9 levels and the game starts off slow,
but it becomes hard quickly. 
# Download Instructions
Download the files in this repository as a zip. Once the zip is finished downloading, extract it to your desktop.
Make sure that you have java downloaded on your computer, and make sure that the libs folder was also downloaded with the jar.
Once everything is extracted to your desktop, you should be able to double click it open. If that doesn't work, right click then 
press open.
# How to Play
To move the helicopter right press 6 or r, to move left press 4 or l, to accelerate press 8 or a, and to brake press 5 or b. 
To turn the sound off and on press 0 and to pause and unpause the game press 1.
